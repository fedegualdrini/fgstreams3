# Architecture

How a match gets from the upstream feeds to the screen. File names are relative to the repo root.

## The catalog (`lib/catalog.ts`)

- Built from five sources in parallel: streamed.pk matches, streamed.pk's live flags, Promiedos, the angulismo feed and the channel catalog. Only the match feed is mandatory; the other three degrade to "no extra data".
- `resolveStreams` looks up every (match, source) pair with a concurrency cap and a time budget. A source that failed or timed out is *unresolved*, which is different from *empty*, and an unresolved match is never dropped.
- Broadcasters come from two feeds with different clocks. Promiedos localises kickoff to the caller's IP, so `estimateFeedOffsetMs` (`lib/teamMatch.ts`) measures the offset from unambiguous name matches; angulismo times are fixed Argentina-local.
- `lib/broadcasters.ts` turns a feed entry into catalog channels (angulismo first, Promiedos fills the rest).
- An empty upstream feed throws `EmptyUpstreamError` so it is never cached. `getCatalog` then serves the last good catalog held in module memory, re-filtered against the current clock.

## Upstream access

- Server data fetches go through `lib/httpClient.ts`: optional timeout, retry on 5xx, Zod validation (`lib/schemas.ts`) and logging. It answers `null` on failure. The experimental Stream Test browser request is a binary POST, not a catalog fetch.
- Each source module (`api`, `promiedos`, `angulismo`, `flashscore`) maps `null` to its own failure signal: `[]`, `ok: false`, or the last good snapshot flagged `stale: true`.
- `lib/logger.ts` is the only code that writes to the console. Lines read `scope: message`.
- Timeouts, retry counts, cache windows and CDN headers live in `lib/constants.ts`, each with the reason for its value.

## API routes (`app/api`)

- `scores/[sport]`, `scores/match/[flashscoreId]`, `streams/[source]/[id]` are wrapped with `withErrorResponse` and answer through `jsonWithCache` (`lib/httpRoute.ts`): one `502 { error }` shape, one place that formats `Cache-Control`.
- `scores/[sport]` adds an in-memory dedup window on top of `unstable_cache` so a burst of cold-start requests produces one Flashscore fetch.
- `diagnostics/broadcasts` is a thin route over `lib/diagnosticsBroadcasts.ts`; `?q=<team>` traces matching fixtures through each catalog stage.
- `hls-proxy` and `media/*` are independent of the catalog (channel playback and TMDB search).

## Client side

- Server pages pass `CatalogMatch` data down as props, so streams and broadcasters are present on first paint.
- `lib/useLiveScores.ts` and `lib/useMatchStats.ts` poll the score routes on the intervals in `lib/constants.ts`; score matching helpers are in `lib/scoreUtils.ts`.
- Playback fallback (rotating to the next stream) uses `lib/streamSelector.ts` for the initial choice.

## Isolated Stream Test

- `/stream-test` accepts only the supported `https://embed.st/embed/<source>/<id>/<number>` shape. It posts the three protobuf fields directly from the browser to `https://embed.st/fetch`; no provider HTML, iframe or JavaScript is loaded.
- `/api/stream-test/decode` reads at most 8 KiB and uses the response's exposed `Goat` header as a 32-byte UTF-8 key. `lib/streamTestServer.ts` unwraps protobuf field 1, reverses the printable-ASCII rotation, base64-decodes, then authenticates ChaCha20-Poly1305 (12-byte nonce, trailing 16-byte tag, no AAD). Only an authenticated HTTPS playlist on an explicit `lb<number>.strmd.st/secure/` origin is accepted.
- `/api/stream-test/manifest` uses `fetchText` with the provider Referer/Origin, a deadline and redirects disabled. Nested playlists are rewritten back through this allowlisted route; CDN media URLs remain direct browser requests. It cannot fetch arbitrary hosts or relay segments.
- Decoder and manifest responses are uncacheable. Response keys and signed playlists are not stored by this feature. The diagnostic player stops on a fatal HLS error instead of entering the channel player's recovery loop.
- This is not a replacement for existing playback. Fresh decoding succeeded locally, but the local Next.js/Node manifest request received provider HTTP 403. A standalone relay did play video; the transport-dependent rejection is unresolved. The page distinguishes decode success from playback failure and never falls back to an iframe.
